# Human-activity-recognition-using-smartphones
 In this project various machine learning and deep learning models have been worked out to get the best final result. In the same sequence, we can use LSTM (long short term memory) model of the Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to recognize various activities of humans like standing, climbing upstairs and downstairs etc
